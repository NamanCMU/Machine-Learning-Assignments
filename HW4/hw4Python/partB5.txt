The hypothesis contained in the version space are not able to predict the output of the test set examples unanimously.
For all the examples of the test set, half of the hypothesis says "high" and the rest half says "low", hence we can not
conclude anything from that.
The thing which can be learned is that although all the hypothesis in the Version Space are consistent with the 
Training Set, it is not necessary that it will give accurate results for the Testing set. It can completely fail on the new examples.
